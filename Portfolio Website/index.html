    <p class="solid">My name is Sean Melfranco Uy. I am 21 years old. I am currently a student studying Bachelors In Computing And I.T in CCT College in Dublin. 
        I am currently in my third year now. I am from the Philippines but I am based in Dublin. I have lived in Ireland for 17 years. 
        I have acquired a wide range of skills over my 3 years of studying in Computing and I.T in CCT College. 
        In this portfolio I will be explaining about each of the skills that I learnt and the number of CAs that I have done in order to help me gain more knowledge on that subject.

     <p class="solid">For Java, we used Netbeans IDE to do our coding on. I learnt about the different variable types which are used to store memory for a value such as int, double, string, char and boolean. In order to put it all together, I have to tell the program to use the variable I want to use and what type and name it will have. I learnt to always comment on my code so that I know what that specific line of code does. I have learnt about conditional statements such as if and switch. 
        These conditional statements are used to allow the program to make decisions on its own based on conditions that I put. I learnt about file access which involves reading from a file. I learnt that I can use a scanner to read from a file. There is also another method to read a file by using a bufferedreader. I learnt about loops and that they are a block of code that is set to repeat a certain number of times. An example of this is a while loop and a do loop. 
        I have done individual CAs such as creating a program to access a file and output it to a new file and creating a small class hierarchy involving 3 separate classes. I have done a number of small practice exercises involving conditional statements, writing to a file, loops, arrays etc.

     <p class="solid">For HTML, CSS and Javascript, I learnt that it is used to create websites. I learnt about HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is a code that allows us to build websites. The anatomy of a HTML element is the building blocks of web pages and examples of this would be paragraph, heading, div, list etc. It uses tags such as opening tags which mark the beginning of an element and a closing tag marks the end. 
        I learnt about CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is not a programming language but it is a style sheet language that lets us style the elements on my page. It works in conjunction with HTML but it is not HTML itself. CSS associates its style rules with HTML elements and CSS properties affect how elements are displayed. I learnt about Javascript which can make websites more interactive, interesting and user-friendly. 
        It lets you access and modify the content and markup of web pages as the user is viewing them. I have done two CAs which involve creating a website. 
        The first CA was about building a website using the front-end technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The minimum of pages was 3 and the content was to write about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The second CA was about creating a web application for a restaurant to calculate the cost of at least 5 customer orders. This involves creating a staff password validator, user customer generation which will generate user profiles and a menu to calculate the food cost whenever a customer orders.

    <p class="solid">I have also experience in cloud computing during my 3 years in my Bachelors in Computing and I.T course. We mostly used Google Cloud. I learnt about cloud which is a distinct IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources. It is privately owned and offers access to IT resources that are metered. Clouds can be based on the use of any protocols that allow for the remote access to its IT resources. I learnt about scaling which represents the ability of the IT resource to handle increased or decreased usage demands. 
        Two types of scaling are horizontal scaling which scales out and scales in while vertical scaling which scales up and scales down. I learnt about setting up different types of virtual machines on Google cloud which allows us to use different operating systems such as Windows and Linux. I also learnt about setting up storage buckets on Google Cloud which allows us to store and upload files into the storage buckets. I can also create new folders and delete existing files and folders. I learnt about downloading Google SDK which is a set of tools and it contains gcloud, gsutil and bq command-line tools which you can use to access Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery and other products and services from the command line. 
        I have done 2 CAs on cloud computing. The first CA involves researching on a data centre, writing about the cost of equipment, security restrictions and discussing three main service models of cloud computing. The second CA involves using Google Cloud and I have to autoscale, stress test, monitor and network load balancing for a test website.
